I'm sorry, but it looks like there are no actual code snippets or AngularJS templates provided in your request. Without any specific code blocks or components from AngularJS to convert into a React component with TypeScript, I'm unable to deliver a meaningful conversion.

To assist you effectively, I would need the actual AngularJS code snippets, including HTML templates and JavaScript or TypeScript code used in AngularJS controllers, services, or any other parts you'd like converted to a new React component.

Please provide the AngularJS code snippets or describe the functionality and structure of the component you wish to convert from AngularJS to React using TypeScript, and I'll be happy to help.
