It seems there was an issue with providing the React component code for analysis. Without the specific code snippet, I'm unable to identify the API endpoints and their corresponding HTTP requests directly from the React component.

To proceed, please provide the React component code that includes the API calls. This will enable me to scan through the code, identify all the API endpoints, their corresponding HTTP requests, and generate the TypeScript service file accordingly.
