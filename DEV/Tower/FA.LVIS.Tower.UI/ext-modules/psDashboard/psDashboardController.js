To proceed with your request, I'll need the content of the AngularJS controller file you mentioned. This will allow me to identify all the API endpoints, HTTP requests, and any other relevant information needed to create the corresponding Axios functions in a new React service file.

Please provide the AngularJS controller file content, and I'll get started on translating its functionality to React for you.
