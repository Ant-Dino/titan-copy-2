To proceed with your request, I'll need the content of the AngularJS controller file you mentioned. This will allow me to identify all the API endpoints, their HTTP requests, and any other necessary information required to create the corresponding Axios functions in a React service file.

Please provide the AngularJS controller file content, and I'll be able to assist you further.
