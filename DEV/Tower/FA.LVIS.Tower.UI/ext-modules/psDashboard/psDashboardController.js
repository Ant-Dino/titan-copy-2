To proceed with your request, I'll need the AngularJS controller file content or at least a detailed description of the API endpoints and their corresponding requests (e.g., GET, POST, etc.) that are used within the AngularJS controller. This information is crucial for accurately creating the React service file with the corresponding Axios functions. 

Could you please provide the necessary details or the content of the AngularJS controller?
