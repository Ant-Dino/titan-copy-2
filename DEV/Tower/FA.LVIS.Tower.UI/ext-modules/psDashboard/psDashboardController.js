To proceed with your request, I'll need the AngularJS controller file or the specific details about the API endpoints and their corresponding requests (e.g., method, URL, and any parameters or data structures involved). This information is crucial for accurately creating the Axios functions in a new React service file. 

Could you please provide the AngularJS controller file or the necessary details about the API endpoints?
